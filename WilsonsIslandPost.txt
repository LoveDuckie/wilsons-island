[B]Good afternoon![/B]

I recognise that I haven't been on the forums for long so this might seem strange that a newcomer such as myself is doing this, but after seeing that a friend of mine kindly donate his work to the community I caught inspiration and decided to do this same.

This was originally a university project of mine and I personally had alot of fun. It even got an [I]A grade[/I]!

I've noticed that although there are tutorials for half the things implemented to this projects code, it can be quite hard to find any information that [B]actually[/B] helps. I found this issue alot when implementing Scaleform into my project.

This project used the [B][U]December 2010 Build[/U][/B] of UDK. So changes to the core base classes of UDK and UnrealScript may have changed since then which in turn might render some of this code useless.

However, it does offer food for thought and give you an idea as to how to implement half of it. And even if some of it fails to work, hopefully the UDN can offer some more light.

Unfortunately I haven't changed the code since my hand-in last year meaning that the last time I built it, it was fine. But considering there have been new builds released since there, there is the possibility that some of it might break if you decide to compile it straight from the download.

[B]Things to extract from this source code ...[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Scaleform HUD code
[*]Navigational Mesh code
[*]Simple "critter" AI code (Wild Boars running around)
[*]Skeletal animation and rigging (i.e. mining would bind a pickaxe to the skeletal character).

Lastly, I am just a coder. These [B][I]awesome[/I][/B] assets that are featured in the packages were not created by me, so here are the following artists that produced the artwork for it.

All the sounds included were recorded by me and friends (and some of the artists).

The trailer music was made by [B]James Lowndes[/B] who I believe used Fruity Loops (or now named FL Studio).

To wrap this all up. This game was meant to feature a coconut narrator that would guide the player on how to play the game. However because the assignment deadline was due sooner than I wanted, I could never implement him.

Here is his frames in action...

If [B][U]anyone[/U][/B] wishes to implement him and then display their progress, it would actually bring a tear of joy to my eye :')

And yes, he was named after the volleyball that was from the popular film [I]Castaway[/I] :)

It took 12 weeks to make the game in total (whilst working on other university modules also).

Any questions are welcome.

Much love,
